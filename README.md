# lsnotes
Add a description to your directories! Simply add a `.lsnotes` file and that's it!

It's a especially simple project, but the idea makes me feel fresh! It should be made a shell project but I don't feel like that. Anyway, it has endless possbilities!

## Installation

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

## Usage

```sh
lsnotes # for viewing the description
lsnotes --view or lsnotes -v # does the same as above

lsnotes --help # for assistance

lsnotes --edit or lsnotes -e # edits the .lsnotes file with your default editor
```

### Examples

```sh
alias ls = "lsnotes && ls"
# etc.
```
